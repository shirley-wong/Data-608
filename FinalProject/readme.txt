Final Project Proposal

Your final project is to create a public visualization using data relevant to a current policy,
business, or justice issue. You may use any dataset you can find for this assignment, as
long as it is either public or you have permission from the data’s owner/administrator to work
with it and share it.

Recommended data sources are: governmental data, data provided by a
non-profit/Nongovernmental organizations, and data available from large, semi-structured
data sets (ie social networks, company financials, etc).

You must document each step of your data analysis process (excluding data acquisition) in
code: this will include changing the format of the data and the creation of any images or
interactive displays that are made.

You must also include a short (2-3 paragraph) write-up on the visualization. This write-up
must include the following: the data source, what the parameters of the data set are
(geography, timeframe, what the data points are, etc) what the data shows, and why it is
important.

Grading:

This assignment will account for 40% of your final grade. Points will be awarded for the
following components:

25% - finding your dataset(s) and getting approval for your project on-time, recognition of
strength/weaknesses of data, analysis to find insights in the data

25% - data handling: cleaning, outlier/null handling, and transfer/loading data to the web

40% - data presentation: compliance with best data visualization practices, clarity, information-to-ink ratio, how memorable the visualization is

10% - contextual write-up: why the data is important, why the insights are important Due Dates:

Note - The type of deliverable you provide will depend on the strategy you use for this
project. If you put together an interactive visualization, you should be able to provide code
that I will be able to run and host locally. If you are choosing static visualizations, your write
up will be more important to your overall grade, and it may be useful to think about how
you’re presenting these visualizations (in a formated R markdown document for example.)

Proposal

You must submit a proposal for your project by [03/26]. This proposal must include: a link to
the data source, an explanation of what you want to show, why this is relevant to a current
policy, business, or justice issue, and which technologies you plan to use.

Your instructor must approve this proposal: you may have to refine this somewhat. You will
present your final project during our last meetup. If you are not able to attend the lecture on
those days, you must write-up a status report with screenshots of current progress and
issues you are experiencing.
